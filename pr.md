2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.
    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?
        - This website seems way more detailed than mine. Detail alone is enough for me to say that this website has a better user experience. It's truly amazing to see what people can do with CSS.
    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
        - In terms of simplicity, my website is more maintainable just by the sheer difference in content between my website and their website.
3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    - The code is very well structured within files.
4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    - No other issues. Reused CSS is not duplicated in the elements, and style is maintained throughout the entire website.
5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    - Really good job! This website is awesome! You've outdone yourself!
